This project was exploring the data found through Philadelphia's bike sharing website https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/. The purpose of this project is to make an interesting animated visualization of the bike activity for 24 hours. The data was cleaned and manipulated using python libraries and command line. One of the libraries used in this project was FFmpeg which is a free and open-source software project consisting of a large suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files.
